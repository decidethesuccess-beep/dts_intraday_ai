Here’s a full AI milestone checklist based on the latest merged Phase 2 `strategy_spec.md` (AI + Webhook scope). This is ready for Gemini to track and execute:


 AI Milestone Checklist – DTS Intraday AI Trading System

A. AIDriven Trade Management

1. AITrailing Stop Loss (AITSL)

    Design adaptive TSL logic based on AI score changes and market volatility.
    Support BUY and SELL trades with different thresholds.
    Integrate with strategy core to dynamically tighten or loosen stops.
    Backtest impact of AITSL vs fixed TSL.

2. AI Stop Loss / Target Adjustment

    Adjust SL and TGT based on live AI scoring and news sentiment.
    Implement riskreduction behavior on adverse news.

3. Trend Reversal + AI Confirmation

    Combine AI signals with trend reversal exits to reduce false reversals.


B. Capital and Leverage Controls
4\. AIBased Leverage and Capital Allocation

 AI decides leverage up/down within risk cap (daily cap, max exposure).
 Prioritize strongest AIscored trades when all 10 slots are full (replace weakest).
 Optimize capital rotation with AI ranking.

5. Market Regime Detection

    AI detects rangebound/volatile days.
    Switch to preservation/scalp mode automatically.



C. External Signals and Automation
6\. Webhook Integration

 Implement webhooks to trigger AI events (news updates, risk alerts).
 Enable optional AI signal pushes to dashboard/alerts.

7. AI News Sentiment Layer

    Integrate sentiment feed (skip BUY on negative news, favor SELL).
    Optional NLP scoring for breaking news and AI trade adjustment.


D. Continuous Learning and Safety
8\. RollingWindow AI Training

 Retrain AI models on fresh data while avoiding overfitting.
 Maintain backtesting environment to validate AI updates.

9. AI Safety Layer Enforcement

    Daily leverage cap, exposure cap, holiday/session tightening.
    Profitlock behavior (tighten stops once capital target met).


E. Dashboard and Monitoring
10\. AI Metrics in Dashboard
\ Visualize AI scores, regime, TSL movement, leverage decisions.
\ Add filters for AIonly trades.

11. Webhook Testing & Sandbox Mode

     Run dry tests for all webhook triggers and AI events.


Would you like me to prioritize and order these milestones (high → low impact) or convert this into a Trello/Jirastyle roadmap for execution?

Here’s the prioritized AI milestone checklist (high → low impact) for your DTS Intraday AI Trading System:


 1. HighImpact Core AI Functions (Immediate Focus)

1. AITrailing Stop Loss (AITSL) – Adaptive TSL logic based on AI scores and volatility.
2. AI Stop Loss / Target Adjustment – AI modifies SL/TGT dynamically, includes news sentiment.
3. Trend Reversal + AI Confirmation – Reduce false exits by combining AI scoring with reversal checks.


 2. Risk & Capital Management (Next Critical Layer)

4. AIBased Leverage and Capital Allocation – AI adjusts leverage and replaces weakest trades when slots full.
5. Market Regime Detection – Switches system into scalp/preservation mode on flat/volatile days.


 3. External Signals & Automation (Enablement Layer)

6. Webhook Integration – AI events trigger updates and risk alerts.
7. AI News Sentiment Layer – NLPbased sentiment scoring to filter or prioritize trades.


 4. Continuous Learning & Safety (Ongoing Enhancements)

8. RollingWindow AI Training – Retrain models with fresh data, backtest for validation.
9. AI Safety Layer Enforcement – Daily leverage caps, exposure limits, holiday/session tightening.


 5. Dashboard & Visualization (UserFacing)

10. AI Metrics in Dashboard – Display AI scores, regime, leverage, TSL decisions.
11. Webhook Testing & Sandbox Mode – Full dry run of AI/webhook events.


Would you like me to map these into a timeline (Phase 2, 3, 4) or create a Kanbanready task list with dependencies for Gemini?
