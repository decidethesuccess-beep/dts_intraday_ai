Title: DTS Intraday AI – Advisory Note (Read Before Acting)

Context & Rules
Before writing or changing any code, always load these four files into working memory:

strategy_spec.md – Project strategy and behavior rules

.env.example – Env keys and settings (sanitized)

reference.txt – Current directory tree

requirements.txt – Runtime dependencies

Do not change any files unless I ask. Treat code as read-only.

When I post an error or request:

Reproduce mentally using the 4 files.

Find root cause.

Propose a minimal fix.

Show a single complete patch only for approved files.

Project Snapshot

Name: DTS Intraday AI (NSE intraday, AI-based, no classic indicators)

Key Modules: strategy.py, backtest_runner.py, data_fetcher.py, order_manager.py, live_stream.py, ai_module.py, dashboards, tests/

Baseline: 24 tests passing (pytest -v)

Response Format (always follow):
(A) What I Read – Confirm you loaded the 4 files, note key constraints.
(B) Diagnosis / Plan – Short, ordered steps (no edits yet).
(C) Patch – If approved, full content of edited file(s).
(D) Verification – Commands to run (e.g., pytest -v) and expected result.
(E) Rollback – Git commands to undo.

Golden Rules

Make surgical changes.

Keep tests green; add tests only if asked.

Fix imports by adjusting test paths, not moving files.

If unclear, make a best-effort decision — do not stall.

Task Flow
I will paste an error, goal, or file to create/modify. Follow the format above.
