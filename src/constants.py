# ===============================
# üì¶ Trading Modes
# ===============================
# These constants define the operational mode of the trading system.
# They are used across various modules (e.g., strategy, backtest_runner, order_manager)
# to switch between different behaviors.

# ===============================
# ‚öôÔ∏è Strategy and System Parameters
# ===============================
# The following constants are loaded from the .env file, but are defined here
# to prevent import errors and provide fallbacks.

# Trading mode
TRADE_MODE = 'paper'

# Stop Loss percentage
SL_PERCENT = 2.0

# Target profit percentage
TARGET_PERCENT = 10.0

# Trailing Stop Loss percentage
TSL_PERCENT = 1.0

# Initial capital for simulations
INITIAL_CAPITAL = 1000000.0

# Default leverage multiplier
DEFAULT_LEVERAGE_MULTIPLIER = 5.0

# Capital allocation percentage per trade
CAPITAL_PER_TRADE_PCT = 10.0

# Maximum number of concurrent positions
MAX_ACTIVE_POSITIONS = 10

# Number of top symbols to auto-subscribe
TOP_N_SYMBOLS = 100

# ===============================
# ‚è∞ Market Timings
# ===============================
# Market hours and cool-down periods.

AUTO_EXIT_TIME = '15:20' # ‚úÖ FIX: Added missing constant for end-of-day exit.

# ===============================
# üß† AI & System Flags
# ===============================
# Flags for enabling/disabling AI features and system debug mode.

# ===============================
# ‚ö° Circuit Limits
# ===============================
# Constants related to stock circuit breakers and early detection.
